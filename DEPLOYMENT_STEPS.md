# Guestbook Contract Deployment Guide
## Deploy to Base Sepolia with Optimized Gas (<$0.20)

### Prerequisites
1. âœ… MetaMask wallet installed and configured
2. âœ… Base Sepolia network added to MetaMask
3. âœ… At least 0.002 ETH on Base Sepolia (for gas fees)
4. âœ… Your wallet: `0xe918f1da0C3A9AC904f10f8B9Ee42C545360d4D7`

### Get Base Sepolia ETH
Get free testnet ETH from:
- https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
- https://docs.base.org/tools/network-faucets

---

## Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

### Open Remix IDE
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create a new workspace or use the default workspace

### Create the Contract File
1. In the File Explorer, create a new file: `GuestbookOptimized.sol`
2. Copy the contract code from `contracts/GuestbookOptimized.sol`
3. Paste it into Remix

---

## Step 2: Compile the Contract

1. Go to the **"Solidity Compiler"** tab (left sidebar)
2. Settings:
   - **Compiler Version**: `0.8.20` or higher
   - **EVM Version**: `paris` (default)
   - **Optimization**: Enable with **200** runs
   - **Auto compile**: Check this box
3. Click **"Compile GuestbookOptimized.sol"**
4. You should see a green checkmark âœ…

### Gas Optimization Settings
The contract is already optimized with:
- âœ… `uint32` for timestamps (saves ~15,000 gas per entry)
- âœ… `immutable` variables for owner and USDC token
- âœ… Efficient storage patterns
- âœ… Minimal event data

---

## Step 3: Check Gas Estimation

Before deploying, Remix will show estimated gas costs:
- Expected deployment gas: ~1,800,000 - 2,200,000 gas
- Base Sepolia gas price: ~0.001 gwei (very low)
- **Estimated cost: $0.005 - $0.015** âœ… (well under $0.20)

---

## Step 4: Deploy the Contract

### Connect MetaMask
1. Go to the **"Deploy & Run Transactions"** tab
2. Set **Environment** to: `Injected Provider - MetaMask`
3. MetaMask will popup - Connect your wallet
4. Ensure it shows **Base Sepolia** network
5. Confirm your wallet address is shown

### Deploy
1. In the **"Contract"** dropdown, select `Guestbook`
2. In the **"Deploy"** section, enter constructor parameter:
   ```
   0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e
   ```
   (This is the USDC token address on Base Sepolia)

3. Click **"transact"** (or **"Deploy"**)
4. MetaMask will popup with transaction details:
   - **Check the gas fee** - should be < $0.05
   - Click **"Confirm"**

5. Wait for confirmation (usually 2-10 seconds)

### Verify Deployment
Once deployed, you'll see:
- âœ… Contract address in the Remix console
- âœ… Deployed contract under "Deployed Contracts" section
- âœ… Green checkmark in MetaMask

**Copy the contract address!** Example: `0x1234...5678`

---

## Step 5: Verify Contract on BaseScan

1. Go to https://sepolia.basescan.org/
2. Search for your contract address
3. Click **"Contract"** tab
4. Click **"Verify and Publish"**
5. Settings:
   - **Compiler Type**: Solidity (Single file)
   - **Compiler Version**: v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6
   - **License**: MIT
6. Paste your contract code (entire file)
7. **Constructor Arguments ABI-encoded**:
   ```
   0x000000000000000000000000036cbd53842c5426634e7929541ec2318f3dcf7e
   ```
8. Click **"Verify and Publish"**

---

## Step 6: Update Frontend Configuration

### Update Contract Address
1. Open `src/lib/paid-guestbook-contract.ts`
2. Replace the contract address:
   ```typescript
   export const PAID_GUESTBOOK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE" as const;
   ```

### Example:
```typescript
export const PAID_GUESTBOOK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890" as const;
```

---

## Step 7: Test the Deployment

### Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Test Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve connection in MetaMask

2. **Check USDC Balance**
   - You need test USDC to sign
   - Get test USDC from faucets or Aave

3. **Approve USDC** (if needed)
   - Click "Approve USDC Spending"
   - Confirm in MetaMask
   - Wait for confirmation

4. **Sign Guestbook**
   - Enter a test message
   - Click "Sign Forever Book (1 USDC)"
   - Confirm transaction (~$0.01 gas)
   - Wait for confirmation

5. **Verify**
   - Check "Recent Signatures" section
   - Your message should appear with your wallet address
   - Check on BaseScan to see the transaction

---

## Step 8: Update API Endpoints (if needed)

If you're using a backend API, update the contract address in:

### Backend Configuration
```javascript
// server/config.js or similar
export const GUESTBOOK_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
```

### Database Schema
If storing contract interactions, update:
```javascript
// Ensure your DB schema includes:
{
  contractAddress: 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
  network: 'base-sepolia',
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Deployment Cost Breakdown

### Estimated Costs (Base Sepolia)
| Item | Gas | Cost (ETH) | Cost (USD) |
|------|-----|------------|------------|
| Deployment | ~2M gas | 0.002 ETH | ~$0.005 |
| First Sign | ~150k gas | 0.00015 ETH | ~$0.0004 |
| Subsequent Signs | ~100k gas | 0.0001 ETH | ~$0.00025 |

âœ… **Total deployment cost: ~$0.005 - $0.015** (95%+ under budget)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Out of Gas" Error
- Increase gas limit in MetaMask
- Default 2,500,000 should be sufficient

### "Insufficient Funds"
- Get more Base Sepolia ETH from faucet
- You need ~0.002 ETH minimum

### "USDC Transfer Failed"
- Make sure you have test USDC
- Approve USDC spending first
- Check allowance with contract

### Contract Not Responding
- Verify contract on BaseScan
- Check if contract address is correct in frontend
- Restart development server

---

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Contract deployed to Base Sepolia
- [ ] Contract verified on BaseScan
- [ ] Contract address updated in `paid-guestbook-contract.ts`
- [ ] Development server restarted
- [ ] Test transaction successful
- [ ] Message appears in "Recent Signatures"
- [ ] Git commit with contract address
- [ ] Deploy cost documented (should be < $0.20 âœ…)

## Production Deployment (Future)

When deploying to Base Mainnet:
1. Use mainnet USDC: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
2. Update frontend to use mainnet contract
3. Deployment cost will be similar (~$5-15 on mainnet)
4. Consider using Gnosis Safe for contract ownership
