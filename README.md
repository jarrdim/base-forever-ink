# Base Forever Book

A blockchain-powered guestbook on Base network with gasless transactions and permanent message storage.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Blockchain Storage**: All messages permanently stored on Base blockchain
- **Gasless Transactions**: Zero gas fees thanks to Coinbase Paymaster integration

## ðŸš€ Smart Contract Deployment

Before the guestbook can write to the blockchain, you need to deploy the smart contract:

1. **Find the contract**: Check `contracts/Guestbook.sol`
2. **Deploy it**: Use Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry (see `contracts/README.md` for detailed instructions)
3. **Update the address**: Add your deployed contract address to `src/lib/contract.ts`

The contract includes:
- Message storage with sender, content, timestamp, username, and tags
- Gasless transaction support via Base paymaster
- Efficient message retrieval functions
- Permanent on-chain storage (no deletion)
